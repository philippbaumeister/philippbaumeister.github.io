I am a postdoctoral researcher at Freie Universit√§t Berlin studying the internal structure and long-term evolution 
of exoplanets. In my research, I am interested in how interactions and feedback processes between the interior and the 
atmosphere of a planet influence its long-term evolution and potential habitability. Furthermore, I am exploring 
the application of machine learning methods to the characterization of exoplanet interiors. To this end, I
developed [ExoMDN]({{< relref "/publication/baumeister-2023-exo-mdn-rapid" >}}), a neural network-based model for rapid 
characterization of exoplanet 
interiors.
